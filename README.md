# 3D_Bin_Packing_Heuristics
Best fit heuristics for 3 dimensional bin packing:

Python Implementation of the Extreme-point Heuristic for 3D-Bin-Packing from "Extreme Point-Based Heuristics for Three-Dimensional Bin Packing" INFORMS Journal on Computing (2008), Teodor Gabriel Crainic, Guido Perboli, Roberto Tadei.

This version incorporates rotations and the nesting of objects within other objects. Additionally, it supports customization of the initial ordering of objects and the merit functions used to select a location from among the feasible locations available.
